<h1>About Me</h1>
<br/>
<p>I am a Java BackEnd developer with 2 and a half years of experience, but currently I want to explore the FrontEnd world as well. :) 
  So here I am creating and uploading my CV webpage, using HTML 5 (and coding in VsCode).
</p>

<p>I really hope and the end of the next year I can proudly call myself a Fullstack developer.</p>

<p>I am always trying to be innovative and learn new things, and I believe clean coding is a key factor in becoming a 
  really great developer.
